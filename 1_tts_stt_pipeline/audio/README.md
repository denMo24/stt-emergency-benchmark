Since our generated audio files containing synthetic dialogues are several gigabytes in size (ca. 75GB for 2000 audio files), they cannot be deposited in this repository. You can generate them by yourself by using "1_TTS.ipynb" (with piper) and "2_Audio_Editing.ipynb" on the synthethic dialogs in the provided mongodb-collection "NLP-EXPANDED-prammed-postprocessed_translation" under the key "final_dialogue".
